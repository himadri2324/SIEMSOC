# SIEMSOC
SIEMSOC is a hands-on Security Operations Center project implementing Elastic SIEM for real-time threat detection and investigation. It collects Windows Event Logs via Winlogbeat, correlates security events in Elasticsearch, visualizes alerts in Kibana, and enables SOC-style analysis of authentication-based attacks.
